# Olympics Data Analytics
Azure end-to-end Data Engineering Project

# Project Overview
This end-to-end Azure analytics project was from Darshil Parmar in Youtube. We did raw data extraction, transformation, loading the data in SQL and dashboard creation.

## Personal Goal
I wanted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Azure data pipeline, starting from the raw data ingestion stage to gaining insighs in SQL and providing a usable dashboard.

### Data Sources

The data source used was the Tokyo Olympic Data of 2021 from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo

### Tools
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Data Lake Gen 2
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Synpase Analytics
- SQL
- Power BI


###
Ingestion: We extract data from the API using Azure Data Factory

Storage: The raw data is loaded into Azure Data Lake.

Transformation: Azure Databricks is employed to write Spark code for data transformation.

Data Loading: The transformed data is then loaded back into Azure Data Lake.

Analytics: Finally, we leverage Synapse Analytics to execute SQL queries and extract valuable insights from the data."
